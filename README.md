# alan-note-taker

## The purpose of this project was to create a Note Taker application that can be used to write and save notes. This app uses express.js for the back end and saves and retrieves the note data from the db.json file. When the user opens the app they will be presneted with a homepage and they will click the get started button to enter the note taker. The user can then write a note title and note text, once they are done writting the note, they can save it by clicking the save icon on the top right in the nav bar. They will then see the note populate on the left side. They can then create a new note and save it, they can click on old notes to populate them as the main note, and they can delete it by clicking the red trashcan.
